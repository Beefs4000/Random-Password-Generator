# Random-Password-Generator

This is a project to create a random password generator. 
Unfortunately I've had to stick to the critera of the assignment, ideally I think a series of 
check boxes and a count box rather than prompts is far less intrusive for the user when selecting
the relevant criteria for the user.

I was helped a lot by watching the tutorial from out instructor, I've gone a bit heavy on commenting on the code,
this is mainly for my benefit, as the it help to get the code to sink in. I may not use the correct syntax for everything
but at least I'll understand it - lol.
